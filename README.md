## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- **403 Forbidden**: Check your API credentials from the developer portal - they may have expired. Regenerate your access token and refresh token from [Electrolux Developer Portal](https://developer.electrolux.one/dashboard)
- **Invalid Credentials**: Double-check your API key, access token, and refresh token from the developer portal

### Connection Issues
- Ensure appliances are connected to your Electrolux account
- Check internet connectivity of appliances
- Verify appliances are powered on and online

### Control Not Working
- Check if appliance has safety locks enabled (door open, child lock, etc.)
- Integration respects all appliance safety features
- Some controls may be disabled during active cycles

### Model Shows as Numbers
- The integration displays the actual product code (e.g., "944188772") used by Electrolux internally
- This is the most specific identifier available through the API
- Marketing model names (e.g., "BSE788380M") are not exposed by the API

### Debug Logging
Enable debug logging in your configuration.yaml for detailed troubleshooting by adding this:
```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.electrolux: debug
```

### JSON Diagnostics for Device Issues
For device-specific issues or when certain features aren't working as expected, a JSON diagnostics file is **very helpful** for troubleshooting:

**How to get diagnostics:**
1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Electrolux**
2. Click on your integration entry
3. Scroll down and click **"Download diagnostics"**

**What it contains:**
- Complete device capabilities schema (what your appliance supports)
- Current appliance state data (real-time values)
- API communication details and errors
- Model and firmware information

**🔒 Privacy & Security:** All sensitive information (API keys, tokens, personal data, emails, addresses, device identifiers, and other PII) is automatically redacted from diagnostics files. They are safe to share when reporting issues.

**When to provide diagnostics:**
- **Missing or incorrect sensors/controls**: If your appliance is missing expected sensors or controls, or if existing ones show wrong values or don't work properly
- Appliance not showing expected controls or sensors
- Commands not working or responding
- New appliance models with unknown features
- Integration setup issues
- Feature requests for specific appliance capabilities

Include this file when reporting issues - it helps identify device-specific problems quickly!
